      passage: ` When a fire alarm goes off, you know it! The sound alerts you to danger. What if you were deaf? How would you know if an alarm went off, or if someone knocked on your door? If you took a walk and strolled across a busy street, you wouldn’t hear if a car beeped at you. A signal dog could help you with all of these things! Signal dogs are also called hearing ear dogs. They help people who are deaf by acting as their owners’ “ears”. They know what to do when they hear certain sounds. These dogs can learn up to eight sounds including sounds from sirens, doorbells, and crying babies. Babies cry at night for many reasons. They might be hungry, lonely or wet. When they cry, the sound is pitiful! Even extremely sleepy parents will wake up quickly to help. But what if a mom and dad are deaf? That’s when a signal dog can help. The dog can quickly wake his owner. He might nudge him with his nose, or pull at his night clothes. When his owner wakes up, the dog runs to the baby. The dog may crouch down near the crib. If his owner doesn’t follow, the dog will run back and forth until his owner takes action. A signal dog does different things for each sound it knows. There is no official kind of hearing ear dog. Many sizes and breeds can be trained. Some dogs are short and fluffy. Others are tall, thin, and sleek. They may not all move with beauty and grace, but all signal dogs are smart. Large dogs are better in public places because they won’t get stepped on. Small dogs, however, can jump in your lap, which is funny! Signal dogs are more than just “ears " for their owners. They are also friends. `,

      passage: `When we talk about ‘lifelong learning’ we’re usually referring to studies that people undertake or courses that they choose to participate in when they’re no longer at the age when you would expect them to be at school or university. The idea behind ‘lifelong learning’ is that gaining new knowledge and developing new skills is an ongoing journey and not just something that we do while we’re at school to gain specific academic qualifications. For this reason, a lot of lifelong learning is a matter of learning something for pleasure or enjoyment. People who like visiting a particular country on vacation might choose to learn the language of that country, so they can communicate with the locals better on their next trip. Often lifelong learning has a more practical purpose for the people who participate in it, however, as it can definitely help improve your career prospects and usually also increase your income. Similarly, the social and emotional advantages of lifelong learning shouldn’t be overlooked. If you’re feeling lonely or isolated, for example, learning something together in a group, whether it’s on or offline, can help reduce those feelings. Another advantage of lifelong learning though is that you can often do it whenever and wherever you are as you can learn from books you can borrow from the library or just have a go at painting a picture and then think of what you could improve to do it a little better the next time. However, people are able to learn, a great sense of achievement can be gained from setting goals, such as being able to speak a foreign language, and then being able to achieve that goal. The effect of achieving goals like these is to help us to feel more content.`,

      passage: `It is most necessary for everyone to cut down on his food expenses. Since the early 1970s the cost of the food has gone up faster than the cost of all commodities and services. The increase has mounted to more than 300%. For all Egyptian families, food is the biggest item in their monthly household. In fact, it swallows more than half the budget of millions of low-income families. People suffer from the high prices of food a lot. How will such a state of affairs end? Is it the fate of low-income families to face starvation? Isn’t there any solution? To be sure, there is. You can reduce your food expenses at least 20% by observing the following pieces of advice. Note the food items you need when your supplies run low. Group the same kind of food together and write a list of your needs. Use your list as you shop and don’t buy any items which are not included on the list. Food is sold nowadays in different forms: fresh, canned and frozen. Choose the cheapest and healthiest ones. You can buy fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones because they are cheaper and healthier. Chickens are cheaper than red meat. You can have cheese, beans and eggs instead of meat. One last bit of advice, “Don’t go shopping on an empty stomach”. Shopping when you are hungry tempt you to buy things you don’t really need.`,

      passage: `Brainstorming is an activity that most of us think we’re very familiar with and know how to do. Perhaps we don’t give very much thought to how or why we do it, but we definitely should. At its best, brainstorming can help us to generate innovative ideas at school and at work, but at its worst, it can be a waste of time. If you want the time, you spend brainstorming to be productive, you need to brainstorm effectively. You may not be aware of the fact that brainstorming, as we know it today, didn’t come into existence until 1948. It was based around a military analogy with the idea being that the participants in the brainstorming sessions were storming or attacking a problem in order to solve it. At that time, the rules of brainstorming were that you didn’t give other participants any negative feedback on their ideas, instead you tried to build on other people’s ideas with your own thoughts. The aim was to generate as many ideas as possible and to think big. When we investigate what makes brainstorming sessions effective, we see that it’s helpful for individual participants to think of ideas on their own first. This could be done by giving each person some prompts to help them come up with ideas that they then write down. You could also ask participants to do some word association by giving them a word and asking them to write other words that come to mind when they think of that word, and then other words connected to those words, and so on. If the participants have already focused on the topic and come up with ideas beforehand, these ideas should be more fully formed and useful and less time will be wasted on this initial stage during the group discussion.`,

      passage: `When we look to the future and consider technology and its effects on education and employment round the world, there are definitely reasons for optimism. It may be easier to see some of these in parts of the world such as the Middle East, Asia and Africa where the creation of global markets for services, such as IT, which previously didn’t exist is allowing talented individuals to have successful careers. We see people in these regions who may not have had access to traditional forms of face-to-face education, such as university studies, taking advantage of online courses to learn computer science. They can then go on to develop codes and create and sell applications, none of which would have been possible without the internet and the associated technology that goes along with it. This phenomenon, however, isn’t only happening in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We’re also seeing new possibilities for employment opening up in other parts of the world where a larger proportion of the population can access conventional university education. We see companies which allow people to make crafts at home, such as handmade jewellery, and sell those items to people all over the world online. These people can become entrepreneurs and they’re opening up markets that wouldn’t have existed forty years ago. All of this suggests that young people today need to develop different types of skills than those who came before them. They need to be able to work independently and manage their time effectively so they can potentially do things like developing a new skill online on their own.
